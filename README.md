###### Git repository for all Unity scenes. Top level should be Unity scenes (ie. file path to start scene when starting in Unity hub) and configurations. For development branching should match the development/branching of any new ros package in [orbit_ros](https://github.com/Steven-Q13/orbit_ros/tree/master) that has to do with a unique Unity scene. When merging back a branch with a package relating to a unique Unity scene in [orbit_ros](https://github.com/Steven-Q13/orbit_ros/tree/master) typically should merge back the corresponding branch in this repository.
